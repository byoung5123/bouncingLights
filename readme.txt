# Bouncing Lights

Simple program written in C++ using the SDL2 library to create an animated simulation of bouncing lights with color attenuation.

## Introduction

This program simulates lights bouncing around a window, creating an animated display of color attenuation. The lights move within the window boundaries, and their colors change based on their position and the attenuation equation.

## Features

- Simulates bouncing lights with color attenuation.
- Utilizes the SDL2 library for graphics rendering.
- Customizable number of lights, their initial positions, velocities, and colors.
- Adjustable parameters for light attenuation and visibility.
